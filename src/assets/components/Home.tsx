            <p>As a junior developer at Northcoders, I apply my strong JavaScript fundamentals and agile skills to create responsive, intelligent, and user-friendly front-end websites. I have a passion for learning new technologies and tools, and I am currently working with Node.js, React, and Firebase to build dynamic web applications.

                I have a background in accounting and finance, with over four years of experience as an accounts assistant and a diploma in accounting from AAT. I made a career change to software development in 2023, after graduating from the Northcoders bootcamp, where I learned how to use HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Git, Adobe, API's, PSQL, and Jest.        </p>
